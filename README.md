This is a small program that will compare the diff between two lists.
<br/> When the program is run user will see the main menu. <br/> There are two ways to compare the lists from the main menu:
* User inputs both of them. User must place (,) between every member of a list.
* User populates the file compare_lists.save. The format must be in the form of list of lists ex [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] . If user adds third or more lists to the file they will not be read due to hard coding the positions of first two lists.
